12days of coding
================

### Methodology

* Build on strength - for speed, use familiar technology (for us, mostly Ruby on Rails)
* Prepare - for new technologies (e.g. a Node app), do some advance reading/tinkering
* DRY - Do not repeat yourself - look for gems wherever possible
* Best practices - we will use TDD; red-green-refactor; frequent commits
* Pragmatism - product should work; function over form (i.e. it doesnâ€™t need to be pretty)
* Modularity - we will try to build templates we can reuse on subsequent days

### How you can get involved

Do you like what you're reading? Try your own mini-rapid-project(s). Do it solo. Do it as a pair. What would you get out of a process like this? How would you structure your efforts? Write about it and send us a link to your post or project.
