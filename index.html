<a name="what-is-12-days-of-coding" class="anchor" href="#what-is-12-days-of-coding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is 12 days of coding?</h3>

<p>It is 12 projects in 12 days. Each project would be started, finished, and shipped in a given October day.</p>

<p>It is an experiment in coding and learning.  It is an experiment in teaming and creating a culture of doing.</p>

<p>I will be blogging about our experience and lessons in [12-days-blog](http://12days.blogspot.com/).</p>

<a name="why-12-days-of-coding" class="anchor" href="#why-12-days-of-coding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why 12 days of coding?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JoshuaJWilborn">Josh</a> and I both had time to kill.  But, not too much.  We wanted to do something fun, build up our coding skills, and our portfolios.  </p>

<p>And we wanted to learn: learn to be better coders, learn to be better builders, learn more about our interests. And that was it. We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves.</p>

<p>We thought a good way to do this would be to create a set of constraints around our efforts. Constraints are key to discipline and focus.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the first choices we made was to keep it short and simple (KISS principle). </li>
<li>We are devoting around 2-weeks to this experiment. </li>
<li>We are keeping this to 2-person engineering team. </li>
<li>We are doing projects we can reasonably finish in a day.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="overview-our-values-and-methodology" class="anchor" href="#overview-our-values-and-methodology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview: our values and methodology</h3>

<p>To be effective, you have to have a process. The hero is neither the knowledge nor the superstar coder. The hero is the process. We want to learn to be better at a successful-building-process by doing.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong></p>

<p>We'd brainstorm a one sentence idea, then share them with each other after 5-minutes. We did a few of these 5-minute sprints. We then scored them using four criteria. The criteria are, in essence, team values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interesting - are they interesting to us?</li>
<li>Simplicity - are they simple enough (for us) to tackle?</li>
<li>Uniqueness - are these ideas unique to us and to others?</li>
<li>Utility - would we use them?</li>
</ul><p>Yes, they are arbitrary. Yes, they are imperfect set of categories. We can live with that. Can you?</p>

<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>

<p>What about the process? No ground-breaking principles here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build on strength - for speed, use familiar technology (for us, mostly Ruby on Rails)</li>
<li>Prepare - for new technologies (e.g. a Node app), do some advance reading/tinkering</li>
<li>DRY - Do not repeat yourself - look for gems wherever possible</li>
<li>Best practices - we will use TDD; red-green-refactor; frequent commits</li>
<li>Pragmatism - product should work; function over form (i.e. it doesnâ€™t need to be pretty)</li>
<li>Modularity - we will try to build templates we can reuse on subsequent days</li>
</ul><h3>

<p>Do you like what you're reading? Try your own mini-rapid-project(s). Do it solo. Do it as a pair. What would you get out of a process like this? How would you structure your efforts? Write about it and send us a link to your post or project. </p>
